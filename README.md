## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14
- React 18
- TypeScript

## Functionality

- Ability to view, add, edit and delete contact cards
- Clicking a card discloses more information
- Search field utilises a datalist of contact names for suggestive search
- API actions are carried out within a modal overlay

## Nice to haves (but ran out of time)

- Advanced client-side form validation through pattern matching
- Server-side schema validation of data sent
- Unit tests
- E2E tests
